    <p><u>A <b>computer(here bold is used)</b> is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically(here underline is used).</u> Modern digital <i>electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs(here italics is used).</i> These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
