    <p class="LucidaConsole">Bhagat grew up in a traditional Punjabi Hindu family. His father served as a lieutenant colonel in the
         Indian Army and his mother worked as a scientist in Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. He was schooled at 
         the Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan. He claims to have been an average student at 15. His love for writing began 
         during his school years. He used to write articles for the literary magazine of his school and seeing his name printed on 
         the magazine as a writer encouraged him to continue writing.

        Bhagat graduated with a B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1995.
        
        Bhagat pursued a Master of Business Administration degree in marketing from the Indian Institute of Management, 
        Ahmedabad (IIMA) and graduated in 1997. In June 2018, IIMA awarded him the "Young Alumni Achiever's Awards 2018" in the Art
        & Entertainment category.[10]
