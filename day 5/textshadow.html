    <p>In January 2001, Wikipedia began as a side-project of Nupedia, to allow collaboration on articles prior to entering the peer-review process.[66] The name was suggested by Sanger on 11 January 2001 as a portmanteau of the words wiki (Hawaiian for "quick") and encyclopedia.[67] The wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org domain names were registered on 12[68] and 13 January,[69] respectively, with wikipedia.org being brought online on the same day.[70] The project formally opened on 15 January ("Wikipedia Day"), with the first international Wikipedias – the French, German, Catalan, Swedish, and Italian editions – being created between March and May. The "neutral point of view" (NPOV) policy was officially formulated at this time, and Wikipedia's first slashdotter wave arrived on 26 July.[37] The first media report about Wikipedia appeared in August 2001 in the newspaper Wales on Sunday.[71]

        The September 11 attacks spurred the appearance of breaking news stories on the homepage, as well as information boxes linking related articles.[72] At the time, approximately 100 articles related to 9/11 had been created.[73] After the 11 September attacks, a link to the Wikipedia article on the attacks appeared on Yahoo!'s home page, resulting in a spike in traffic.[74]</p>
