    Ernest Rutherford was born 30 August 1871 in Brightwater, a town near Nelson, New Zealand.[12] He was the fourth of twelve children to James Rutherford, an immigrant farmer from Perth, Scotland, and his wife Martha Thompson, a schoolteacher from Hornchurch, England.[12][13] Rutherford's birth certificate reads 'Earnest', possibly due to a clerical error.[12][14] He studied at Havelock School,[15] then in 1887, on his second attempt, won a scholarship to study at Nelson College.[16] On his first examination attempt, he received 75 out of 130 marks for geography, 76 out of 130 for history, 101 out of 140 for english, and 200 out of 200 for arithmetic, totalling 452 out of 600 marks.[17] With these marks, he had the highest of anyone from Nelson.[18] When he was awarded the scholarship, he received 580 out of 600 possible marks.[19] After being awarded the scholarship, Havelock School presented him with a five volume book, titled "The Peoples of the World".[20] He was also offered a cadetship in government service, but he declined as he still had 15 months of college remaining.[21] After his second attempt, in 1889, he won another scholarship to study at Canterbury College, University of New Zealand, where he participated in the debating society, was head boy and played rugby. He studied there between 1890 and 1894.[16] At Canterbury, he was awarded a complex BA in Latin, English, and Maths in 1892, a MA in Mathematics and Physical Science in 1893, and a BSc in Chemistry and Geology in 1894.[22][23]
